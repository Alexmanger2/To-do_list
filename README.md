# To-do_list

App lets people update/add/delete todo's to their todo list once they sign up via email. The email is checked with user auth to prevent someone signing up with the
same email.

The user can log out and sign in with another email that is stored in a database with other todo's linked to that specific email.

User can add/delete/edit todos with buttons aligned with each todo.
